title: Kruglendar — the diary poster
---

I believe, this calendar is the most convenient way to have a bird view on the whole year.

Stick the poster beside your workplace. Or in the toilet. Put a thin marker nearby.

Use it to make notes about future and past events. The finished kruglendar worth keeping it, so in few years you could unroll it to refresh your past adventures in memory and lift your mood.

<div markdown="1" data-name="habits">
Make habits
---
Play the ‘getting habits’ game! Make the checklist of 1—3 items to do them daily. Mark the days when you accomplished everything you aimed to.

Here’s mine:

- Get up at 8:00AM
- Read at least one page of the book.

Keep the chain of successfull days groing. When you fell you’ve made the habbit, remove it from the checklist to start a new one.
</div>

<div markdown="1" data-name="long-term">
Mark events without specific date
---
Sometimes you know an approximate event date only. Draw it somewhere around proper dates, far from the circle.

It allows you to make approximate plans, to note long term events like reading books or taking courses.
